The rigid training of that era was hard for me, I was yearning for modern art and had the feeling that my own investigations would be more satisfying... So I left.

This was when all of the currents in modern art were coming into force... the old petty-bourgeois art was dying and we just happened to be there. I’d say that this influenced us greatly, and determined where our artistic paths would lead...

[[Was there a particular moment this change manifested itself?->EF-010]]

In the Kinský Gardens in 1905, there was an exhibition by Edvard Munch, which led me get together with my friends and form the “Eight”. Edvard Munch was also the inspiration for my early Expressionist painting “Reader of Dostoyevsky”, which in time became quite the subject of discussion.

This is what I wrote in Volné směry (the artistic journal of the Mánes Artists’ Alliance): “The work of Munch went off like a firecracker in our hearts... All of our desires, loves and hopes were at once realised, we were in a state of permanent excitement ... because we saw in him a guardian angel of our future path and the one to bless our resolution to become artists of today. We thought and felt that Munch had arrived for us alone”.

When I was in Paris in 1910 and saw the paintings of Picasso and Braque... this is when I encountered Cubism. I really wanted to move there to study the work of French Cubism in greater depth...

My plans were changed by the assassination of Franz Ferdinand, successor to the Austro-Hungarian throne, and the consqeuence – the start of World War I. My wife and I had to flee France for the Netherlands.

I had decided to go to Paris along with my wife... I came there to seek and find answers to the questions of art, and, all of a sudden, we were regarded as members of a hostile power. The French officials had no concept of the idea of a “Czech”. For them, we were “sujet autrichien” – subjects of Austria.

We fled through Belgium by train; we were arrested and taken to the military fortification in Antwerp, where they threatened to shoot us – we only narrowly escaped death.

[[How did it work out?->EF-017]]

In the end, we were able to save ourselves. The general in command understood our argument that we weren’t Germans but members of a nation that hoped, after centuries beneath the Austro-Hungarian yoke, to finally find its freedom. He took pity on us, found a loophole in the regulations, and instead of having us shot simply had us deported.

Even before the war broke out, when it could already be felt in the air, my friends and I discussed how the conflict could be a unique chance to free our nation from the chains of the monarchy. I, though, unlike several of them felt that we, as a nation, were not yet ready for war. But any efforts for autonomy I’d try to support however I could. An independent Czechoslovakia, it was believed, could also form a counterweight to Germany and Hungary, which then occupied much of the territory where our fellow citizens lived.

Slovakia, I thought, was part of our shared country, and Slovaks were an important part of the Czechoslovak nation. Even as a student, I hiked through almost the whole Moravian-Slovakian borderlands, and also traversed much of Slovakia then under Hungarian rule. I was impressed by Slovakia’s landscapes and traditions, and thought and wrote much about them.

Shortly after the war, we returned to Czechoslovakia and I served for a brief time at the Foreign Ministry. Government work, though, soon gave way to full-time painting, and once again I returned into the labyrinth of my Cubist still-lifes.

We moved to Amsterdam, and I painted a lot, mostly Cubist still-lifes. After the declaration of an independent Czechoslovakia, I also helped to organise the Czechoslovak embassy in The Hague. Shortly after the war, we returned to Czechoslovakia, and I served for a brief time at the Foreign Ministry, but very soon I gave it up and turned primarily to painting.

As my model, I took the heroes of Greek mythology.

Essays about art, and also philosophical texts about freedom... these are the fruit of 2000 long, cruel nights, when instead of sleep and dreams I remained half-poised between waking and dreaming, and the most convoluted ideas arose in me...

Socialist Realism was entirely an ideological construct. Whoever didn’t adapt to its demands wasn’t allowed to do creative work... and I wasn’t really one to adapt myself. So I received an invitation to a “comradely discussion”.

For my seventieth birthday, I prepared for the Mánes Gallery in Prague an exhibition from my series “Songs”, but on June 21st 1951 I was invited for this “discussion”. In fact, it was more like a court hearing. I had to meet with a committee set up from members of the Third Regional Centre of the Union of Czech Artists, who provided their views on the exhibit.

[[What was the problem?->EF-063B]]
[[How did it turn out?->EF-THREAD-004]]


:: EF-063B [speaker-filla] {"position":"900,3150","size":"100,100"}
At the start, they pretended to be highly respectful, but soon it became clear that “Songs” was not of their liking. It was, they said, ugly, gloomy, not in a technique “from our traditions”, and also the paintings were not realistic enough, not heroic, and other similar complaints. This was the classic line of the Communists: dogmatism masked by polite phrases, and arguments that on closer examination turned out to be utter nonsense. In the end, they prohibited the exhibition of any work of mine except for the landscapes of the Central Bohemian Mountains.

My inspiration? A hard question to answer. There was the entire spectrum of modern French art, names like Braque, Matisse, Picasso, Rouault... all the names that stood for absolute creative freedom. At times I also drew inspiration from Kandinsky, Klee and Chagall, yet as for the strongest influence on my artistic development, the specific artist was not that important. I’m thinking, for instance, about medieval art or children’s drawings.

If an ordinary Slovak walked into our studio and saw our works, he’d usually clutch his head in his hands in horror, run out onto the staircase without a word, and usually not even stop until the end of the street. The Slovak spirit then still remained in its sweet rest, in the outlived folklore.

Slovakia’s landscapes and their traditions really are an inexhaustible source of artistic inspiration. It’s enough to walk through just one region of many and you’ll have enough to paint for several weeks to come.

[[Did you return to Prague?->EF-020D]]


:: LF-030 [speaker-fulla] {"position":"525,1525","size":"100,100"}
We proclaimed a new, modern art. And we did so in images and in words: “Art is play and joy!”

[[Do you mean by this your manifesto?->LF-031]]
[[Did you also work in different genres or artistic media?->LF-082]]


:: LF-031 [speaker-fulla] {"position":"650,1650","size":"100,100"}
Yes, we published the first manifesto of Slovak avant-garde art. It was called <a href="https://www.webumenia.sk/clanok/sukromne-listy-fullu-a-galandu" target="_blank"> Private Letters of Fulla and Galanda</a>. But at the time, we didn’t think of it as a manifesto, it was basically a journal. We took care with the typography and design, tried to keep to the language of the ordinary reader. 

[[I’d like to see a sample.->LF-SLFG-IMG-01]]
[[What was the intention of the publication?->LF-031B]]


:: LF-031A [speaker-fulla] {"position":"1025,1650","size":"100,100"}
We fought against the stereotypes used then to judge painting and artwork. An artistic image lives its own autonomous life, it has no decorative purpose. If people use artworks to decorate their interiors, it is simply a habit and we didn’t object to that.

A picture is a picture, not a section of the landscape. Painting is the play of lines and colour-forms; and from these elements, based on standards of taste, we create the work of art.

We fought against the idea of art that slavishly imitates reality. The function of painting is to create a new emotive reality: using colour, light, surfaces... A picture is a picture, not a section of the landscape. Painting is the play of lines and colour-forms; and from these elements, based on standards of taste, we create the work of art.

Unfortunately, our efforts came up against the barriers of contemporary taste. The daily press took no interest in our publication, at the most we were accused of snobbery. We were at least backed up by Josef Vydra. He even wrote a piece for the third issue where he appealed to the young generation of artists not to remain caught in mediocrity. It could be said that in these years, our work was valued more abroad than at home. 

[[Did you find this discouraging?->LF-031D]]

I remained firm in my artistic convictions, but the Private Letters only came out in four issues. Over time, I worked less and less with Mikuláš. My greater success came later, with the painting “Song and Labour”.

It’s a kind of a mythical portrait of the Slovak nation, bringing together all of the various inspirations that I’d been collecting till then. As you can see, the composition is divided into three horizontal sections, just as in the medieval frescoes. The individual figures and scenes are sized to serve the picture's inner order, not to refer to any real subjects.

In the painting “Song and Labour”, I wanted to celebrate Slovak national traditions and folklore, but without the nationalist pathos that was back then somewhat of a fashion. They even wrote about us that we were not national enough, in the same way that Manet and Cézanne were not French enough. But we had the same idea expressed in our Private Letters – a painting can be “Slovak” even if it doesn’t moralise, or openly lament, the unfulfilled yearnings of the Slovak nation.
